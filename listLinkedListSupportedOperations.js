/*
***List - ordered sequence of elements [1 2 3 4 5]
Supported operations: *Only add/delete from end
Lookup by location/index is O(1)
Modify element at index O(1)
Delete from end O(1)
Add to end O(1)

Can add behavior to a list:
Add to beginning, random deletion- O(n) - essentially have to modify each element after and then delete from end
Does it contain something? O(n) *for set, O(1)
.indexOf() - O(n)
Filing cabinets, looking by label vs finding 

***Linked List - some information with instructions to the next in the sequence, essentially ordered sequence as well, less efficient, have to follow the directions to the next one
Random addition much easier just manipulate the links and the element
Supported operations: â€¨Follow chain O(1)
Manipulate chain (Delete/insert at any spot) O(1)

Can add behavior to a list:
Does it contain something? O(n)
Lookup at specific index O(n)
Go to a spot O(n)
