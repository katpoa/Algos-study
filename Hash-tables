Linked List

Assume youre at the position where you want to do the operation already
Insert: O(1)
Delete: O(1)

Find: O(N)

List
Add/Delete from end: O(1)
Find by index: O(1)
Find by element: O(N)

Binary Search Tree
Find by element: O(logn)
Add/delete with find: log(height) or O(height) depending on structure of tree

Hash Table - a data structure that can give us find in O(1) time

a = {3: 'a'} // hash map - key: value pair, Javascript objects don't allow multiples of keys
new Map() // = Python dict, single value vs key : value pair
b = set() // doesn't record duplicates
set operations:
  add O(1) // not O(1), worst case O(N) but highly unlikely - *"amortized"* O(1) bc only in special cases of needing to double total indices - **"expected"** O(1)
  delete O(1) // O(1) amortized and expected
  has O(1) // O(1) expected
  // lookup by index - don't want this
  size O(1) // O(1) normal - implement a counter
  // # of elements

// Java has tree sets, backed by BSTs but 90% use sets instead
